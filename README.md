## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

We may be at BYU, but let's face it - gambling is really fun. However, many of us do not want to put our bank accounts or eternal salvation in jeapordy through the sinful, financially risky practice of gambling. This fake-money blackjack website allows users to experience the fun of gambling without having to go bankrupt or go to hell. Users can play blackjack against the computer dealer using standard rules, look at their win rate throughout previous games, and compare their success to other players. Each user who falls below the minimum threshold of credits in their account will have a base amount replenished at the end of each day - enough to let them keep playing tomorrow, but little enough to keep them worried about losing it for the authentic gambling experience.

### Design

![Design image](BlackjackMockup.png)

Here is a basic mockup of how the website would look during the game. It would also have separate pages for the "about the website" information and for login.

### Key features

- Secure login over https
- Display of cards
- Options to deal cards, double down, hit, and stand
- Credits replenish daily at midnight
- Leaderboard of top scores from players, updated in realtime
- "About" page with website information and blackjack rules

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - HTML used appropriately throughout. Three pages: about, login, game.
- **CSS** - CSS styling that is clear and clean to minimize user confusion. Colors and space will be neatly used and the cards will be easy to read.
- **React** - Login/logout and all interactive gameplay components. Backend endpoint calls will also be performed here.
- **Service** - Endpoints will be implemented to support:
  - Log in/out
  - Storing of data after each round of the game
  - Storing/retrieving a user's credits
  - Displaying jokes from [Geek Jokes API](https://github.com/sameerkumar18/geek-joke-api) on the "about" page
- **DB/Login** - Authentification information, previous games, and credit amounts will be stored in the database.
- **WebSocket** - The current scores/credit amounts for each player will be displayed on a leaderboard and updated in realtime.

- [x] **HTML pages** - Index page for login, Play page for the main game, and About page for rules and Joke API.
- [x] **Proper HTML element usage** - I used appropraite HTML tags throughout, including main, menu, nav, header, footer, div, etc.
- [x] **Links** - There are links between pages and a link to my github page.
- [x] **Text** - The rules for the game are displayed on the about page, as well as a few other small text blocks.
- [x] **3rd party API placeholder** - The About page has a placeholder where I will implement the Geek Jokes API.

- [x] **Login placeholder** - The index landing page is a placeholder for a login page.

## ðŸš€ CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Header, footer, and main content body** - Header and footer are consistent between pages and have been styled to have a title/logo and a navbar on the header and my name/github link on the footer. Login page has no navigation.
- [x] **Navigation elements** - The header navbar has links to play and about pages, as well as a logout button that will log users out and return them to the login page.
- [x] **Responsive to window resizing** - Used flexbox throughout. Per Dr. Ventura's suggestion, I didn't worry too much about mobile sizing, but the content is dynamically arranged, so it should work between different sizes alright.
- [x] **Application elements** - Placeholders for game functions are styled. Includes buttons, cards, and the leaderboard.
