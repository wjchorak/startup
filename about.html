            <p>
                Blackjack is a card game played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The goal is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points, and Aces can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on what benefits the hand most.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You are dealt two cards, face-up, while the dealer gets one face-up and one face-down card. You can choose to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (keep your hand as is). You may continue to hit until you are satisfied with your hand or exceed 21, at which point you "bust" and lose automatically. You may also choose to double down, in which case you will draw only one more card before standing and double your bet.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once you have completed your turn, the dealer reveals their face-down card and must hit until their hand totals 17 or higher. If the dealer busts or your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's, you win. If your hand is lower or you bust, the dealer wins. A blackjack (an Ace and a 10-point card) beats any other hand, including a 21 achieved with multiple cards.

                Generally, gambling is an addictive activity that can lead to financial and spiritual ruin. This site is intended to offer some of the fun associated with blackjack while avoiding the less savory parts of the experience.
